**OLIVE LEAF COMPOUNDS**  

*General information:*  Oleuropein is the main bioactive phenolic compound found in olives and olive leaves from the olive tree (Olea europaeca L.). Oleuropein can reduce the rates of cancer occurrence as well as the development of a variety of cancers (brain, head and neck, breast, liver, bladder, prostate, and skin, as well as leukemia).     Boss A, Bishop KS, Marlow G, Barnett MP, Ferguson LR. [Evidence to Support the Anti-Cancer Effect of Olive Leaf Extract and Future Directions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27548217/) *Nutrients*. 2016;8(8):513. Published 2016 Aug 19. doi:10.3390/nu8080513

*Anti-cancer effects of Oleuropein:* Inflammation and DNA damage from reactive oxygen species play a role in cancer development. Oleuropein has both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects which help to prevent cancer. Once cells become cancerous, they rely on many chemical signaling factors to promote their growth and organization into tumors. Laboratory and animal studies indicate that oleuropein can inhibit cancer cell proliferation, tumor growth and angiogenesis as well as induce apoptosis [[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7072393/#B23-cancers-12-00317),[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7072393/#B24-cancers-12-00317),[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7072393/#B25-cancers-12-00317)].   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28612982/  Olive leaf compounds inhibit growth factors, disrupt signalling pathways, and suppress an enzyme that cancer cells rely on to derive and store energy from dietary carbohydrates. For example, oleuropein inhibits the production of “protein-melting” enzymes that cancer cells need in order to invade healthy tissues and metastasize to distant parts of the body. 

*How Oleuropein may be effective for HER2+ Cancers:* Although all of the following studies were completed on HER2+ breast cancer cells in the laboratory, not in a clinical setting, oleuropein may offer benefits to HER2+ cancer patients in several different ways:

1. HER2 receptors are inhibited by Oleuropein.  Fayyaz S, Aydin T, Cakir A, et al. [Oleuropein Mediated Targeting of Signaling Network in Cancer. ](http://europepmc.org/article/MED/26873189#impact)Current Topics in Medicinal Chemistry. 2016;16(22):2477-2483. DOI: 10.2174/1568026616666160212123706.

2. Trastuzumab efficacy was increased up to 50-fold when oleuropein aglycone was added in a laboratory setting to HER2+ breast cancer cells.

Published 2007 May 9. doi:10.1186/1471-2407-7-80

 3. In laboratory tests on HER2+ cells, acquired resistance to Trastuzumab (Herceptin) was reversed with oleuropein. [](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17490486)

 Other studies of interest:

1. When 1% oleuropein was put in the drinking water of mice with a high spontaneous rate of sarcomas, the sarcomas completely regressed and disappeared in 9 to 12 days. When the tumors were examined before they vanished, they were found to have a disordered, crumbly consistency, and no cancer cells remained

 2. Oleuropein promotes a downregulation of HER2 by blocking ATP binding to the tyrosine kinase domain of the protein.
