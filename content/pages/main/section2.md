**T**he HER2 gene (also called Her-2/neu or erb-b2) is one of more than 100,000 genes that can be found in the nucleus of all human cells. It codes for proteins that are vital for cell growth, division and repair. Normal cells have only two copies of the HER2 gene. I**n HER2-positive breast cancers, cells have too many copies of the*HER2/neu*gene, referred to as gene amplification.**This results in excessive numbers of HER2 protein receptors on the cancer cell’s surface, commonly referred to as ‘protein overexpression’ and HER2 ‘positivity’.

Having excessive copies of the HER2 gene occurs is  considered a mutation but not one that is inherited. Thus it can not be passed on to children as can the[ BRCA1 or BRCA](https://drsusanloveresearch.org/breast-cancer-high-risk/) cancers. Nor does having a close relative with HER2-positive breast cancer increase your risk for developing HER2-positive cancer.
