intro: "If you have arrived at this website, you or someone you love likely has
  a type of cancer called HER2 positive. We developed this website as a means of
  consolidating information that includes both alterative and traditional
  treatments for HER2 cancers. You'll find other information that we have came
  across as we researched treatment.  "

HER2 positive (HER2+) cancers have an excessive amount of a protein that causes cells to grow and divide out of control. HER2 positive cancers occur in about 20% of all breast cancers, and can be found in other cancerous tissues (Ex:stomach, ovary, uterus,colon, bladder, lung, uterine cervix, esophagus). HER2+ cancers are linked to a higher likelihood of metastasis (spread of cancer to other organs), relapse, and decreased overall survival time. However, the discovery and administration of monoclonal antibody drugs (e.g. Herceptin, Perjeta) have improved survival by preventing the HER2 positive cancer cells from receiving growth signals. https://drsusanloveresearch.org/her2-breast-cancer/
