**HERCEPTIN**

Trastuzumab (trade name is Herceptin; produced by F. Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland) is a laboratory-created monoclonal antibody that attaches to HER2 proteins on cancer cells causing the growth of the cancer to stop.    

\     *Details:* Trastuzumab is an IgG1 kappa light chain monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of HER2. 

\    *When is it used?* All stages of HER2 positive cancers. Trastuzumab alone has efficacy in patients with advanced, refractory HER2-positive breast cancer; But improved survival occurs when it is used in combination with taxanes. In women with early breast cancer that is HER2 positive, multiple trials (The Herceptin Adjuvant, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-31, North Central Cancer Treatment Group N9831, and Breast Cancer International Research Group BCIRG 006) have shown that trastuzumab reduces the risk of recurrence by approximately 50% in this population and the risk of death by one third.[](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2008.16.8351#)Add reference. 



Similar to Herceptin, Perjeta is a monoclonal antibody that attaches to HER2 receptors on the surface of breast cancer cells and prevents them from receiving growth signals. It targets a different area on the HER2 receptor than Herceptin, which means it can act as a complementary treatment or serve as an alternative therapy for Herceptin-resistant disease.
